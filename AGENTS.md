# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
`azure-functions-scaffold` is a CLI and library for scaffolding production-ready Azure Functions Python v2 projects.

## Read First
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Working Rules

### Test Coverage
- Maintain test coverage at **95% or above** for committed changes and PRs.
- Run `hatch run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing -q` to verify before submitting changes.
- Any PR that drops coverage below 95% must include additional tests to compensate.
- Keep repository-level engineering and planning docs at the repository root (`AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PRD.md`).
- Keep `docs/` for user-facing documentation only.
- Use Makefile entry points for contributor guidance and CI (`make install`, `make format`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test`, `make cov`, `make check-all`, `make docs`, `make build`).
- Runtime code must remain compatible with Python 3.10+.
- Public APIs must be fully typed.
- Avoid silent behavior changes; document and discuss breaking changes before release.
- When changing CLI behaviour or generated template output, update docs, examples, and tests in the same change.
- Keep repository structure aligned with sibling azure-functions-* repositories.
- `make check-all` is the minimum merge gate.
- Use Conventional Commits with allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`.
- Pin every external GitHub Action `uses:` ref to a full commit SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md` § "GitHub Actions Pinning"](CONTRIBUTING.md#github-actions-pinning) for the policy and approved exceptions.

### Documentation & Translations
- English (`README.md`) is the **canonical** source of truth for all documentation. Translated READMEs (`README.ko.md`, `README.ja.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`) are **best-effort**, community-maintained, and may lag the English source.
- Translation sync is **not** required in the same PR as an English change, and a PR is **never** blocked by translation drift. Update translations opportunistically; when you do, keep them faithful to the current English source.
- Each translated README carries a staleness banner linking back to the canonical English README. Keep that banner in place so readers always know the translation may be out of date.

## Issue Conventions

Follow these conventions when opening issues so the backlog stays consistent with sibling DX Toolkit repositories.

### Title

- Use Conventional Commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `perf:`.
- Add a scope qualifier when it narrows the area: `feat(template):`, `docs(cli):`, `refactor(generator):`.
- Keep the title imperative, under ~80 characters, no trailing period.
- Do **not** put `[P0]` / `[P1]` / `[P2]` (or any priority marker) in the title — priority is tracked with a `priority:p0` / `priority:p1` / `priority:p2` label.

### Body

Use the following sections, in order, omitting any that do not apply:

```
## Context
What problem this issue addresses and why now. Note the target release (e.g. vX.Y.Z) here if known.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Concrete, verifiable items.

## Out of scope
- Items intentionally excluded, with links to the issues that track them.

## References
- PRs, ADRs, sibling issues, external docs.
```

### Labels

- Apply at least one of `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `chore`.
- Apply exactly one `priority:p0` / `priority:p1` / `priority:p2` label to record priority (replaces the old `## Priority` body line).
- Add `area:*` labels when they exist in the repository.
- Use `blocker` only when the issue blocks a release.

### Umbrella issues

When splitting a large piece of work into focused issues, keep the umbrella open as a tracker that links each child issue with a checkbox; close it once every child is closed or explicitly deferred.

### Project management model

This repository is **issue-based, not milestone-based**. Track and group work using issues plus the existing label taxonomy — do **not** introduce parallel structures.

- Plan and group multi-issue efforts with an **umbrella tracker issue** (see above) plus the existing `priority:p0` / `priority:p1` / `priority:p2` labels. Do **not** create GitHub Milestones — none exist by design, and their absence is an intentional signal, not an oversight.
- Do **not** invent new label taxonomies (e.g. `epic:*`, `vNext`, release-tag labels) to group work. Reuse `priority:*`, `area:*` (only where they already exist), and the umbrella issue. Propose any new label in discussion and wait for explicit approval before creating it.
- Treat optional or tentative suggestions ("we could…", "it might be nice to…", "~해도 괜찮아") as **discussion, not a directive**. Confirm intent before making any structural change to how work is tracked (milestones, labels, project boards, issue hierarchies).
- Before adding any organizational structure, check whether the repository already has an established convention. A category being empty or unused (zero milestones, no `epic:*` labels) is evidence to follow the existing pattern, not to introduce a new one.

## Validation
- `make test`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make build`

## Release Process
- Version is managed via `hatch` (dynamic from `src/azure_functions_scaffold/__init__.py`).
- **Do NOT manually edit version strings.** Use the Makefile targets below. The public-API test reads `__version__` against `importlib.metadata.version(...)`, so no test changes are needed when bumping.

### Commands
- `make release-patch` — bump patch version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make release-minor` — bump minor version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make release-major` — bump major version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make release VERSION=x.y.z` — set explicit version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make tag-release VERSION=x.y.z` — create and push an annotated tag (used internally by release targets)

### Flow
1. `make release-patch` (or `-minor` / `-major`) on `main`
2. This runs: `hatch version` → `git commit` → `make changelog` → `git commit` → `git tag` → `git push`
3. Tag push triggers **Publish to PyPI** GitHub Actions workflow automatically.
4. Update `docs/changelog.md` separately if needed (different format from `CHANGELOG.md`).
5. **Verify the release against the dogfood cookbook.** Once **Publish to PyPI** succeeds, confirm the downstream consumer still passes on the freshly published version:
   - In [`azure-functions-cookbook-python`](https://github.com/yeongseon/azure-functions-cookbook-python), upgrade to the new release (`hatch run pip install -U "azure-functions-scaffold>=X.Y,<1"`) and run `make test`.
   - Treat any new `RuntimeWarning`/`DeprecationWarning` surfaced by this library during the cookbook run as a release-blocking signal — decorator-order and API-drift problems are reported as warnings, so a clean run (zero warnings from this package) is part of the release gate.
   - If the cookbook pins a lower bound (`azure-functions-scaffold>=X.Y,<1`), bump it to the new minor in the same verification PR so examples are tested against the version they advertise.
   - A release is **not** considered done until the cookbook passes on the published version.

## Branch Hygiene

- Merged PR branches are deleted automatically ("Automatically delete head branches" is enabled on this repository); keep that setting on.
- When merging from the CLI, always pass `--delete-branch` (e.g. `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`) so the head branch is removed.
- Never delete `main` or `gh-pages`, and never delete a branch that still has an open PR.
- Run `git fetch -p` periodically to prune stale local tracking refs.
