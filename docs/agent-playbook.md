# Agent Playbook

## Source Of Truth
- `AGENT.md` for repository-wide engineering and agent rules.
- `README.md` for installation, quick start, and CLI examples.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for branch, commit, and release workflow.
- `pyproject.toml` and `Makefile` for supported commands.

## Repository Map
- `src/azure_functions_scaffold/` package code.
- `tests/` scaffolding CLI and template coverage.
- `examples/` example generated projects.
- `docs/` documentation site content.

## Change Workflow
1. Confirm whether the change affects scaffolding CLI, template output, generated project structure, or docs only.
2. Update examples when they are used as public contract material.
3. Keep tests and docs in lockstep for public behavior changes.
4. Do not broaden supported Python versions or dependency ranges casually.

## Validation
- `make test`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make security`
- `make build`
